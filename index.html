        Danger Force is an American comedy television series created by Christopher J. Nowak that premiered on Nickelodeon on March 28, 2020. 
        The series is a spinoff of Henry Danger and includes returning stars Cooper Barnes and Michael D. Cohen. 
        Starring alongside them are Havan Flores, Terrence Little Gardenhigh, Dana Heath, and Luca Luhan.
        Captain Man reads down the crimes as Danger Force retaliates when they hear that somebody stole books from the Swellview Library except for the books written by Captain Man. 
        Shout-Out states that they can disguise themselves as villains in order to infiltrate Villains' Night at The Beating Dungeon to see if any of them stole the library books. 
        Schwoz provides them with villainous disguises to infiltrate The Beating Dungeon. 
        Captain Man becomes Hawkfist, Volt becomes El Stabbador, AWOL becomes Weird Beard, Shout-Out becomes Mangler, and Brainstorm becomes a Yerban Santa Claus. 
        At The Beating Dungeon, the Butcher hosts Villains' Night which is attended to by Betty Blades, Lawn Ranger, the Lizard Twins, Dead Bull, Doug the Thug, and other unnamed villains. 
        The incognito Danger Force talks to each of the villains where some of them have no knowledge of them until they came across Book Thievin' Steven who burns and shreds them instead of reading them. 
        Shout-Out gives herself away when she screams at Book-Thievin' Steven for what he does to the books as the villains converge on her. 
        Captain Man as Hawkfist (where he keeps changing his name to Hawkules and Talented Mr. Hawkly) uses a doughnut to fake a bleeding to take her down until Betty Blades identifies the blood as raspberry jelly which disappointed the villains. 
        The rest of Danger Force gives themselves away as Ray sneaks off to become Captain Man in order to fight the villains.
        Sharona Shapen arrives at the Swellview Academy of the Gifted where is she now working for Swellview as a school inspector after
        getting fired from her teaching job at Swellview Junior High. 
        In order to get a license to run the school, she wants to see all types of education or she will be shutting it down. 
        The next day, Shapen watches the education and rates every lesson.
